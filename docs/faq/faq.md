??? info "What is ASM?"

	Operation falcon [attack surface management](https://github.com/Deepanjalkumar) helps to mitigate the risk. We focus on both internal
    and external vulnerable attack vectors. Attack surface management is basically how an attacker sees 
    organization assets to be vulnerable and to be precise exploited by attacker.
    It ranges from domain name to ip assets to vulnerable web application or a missing security patch. 
    In short any assets belonging to organization that is vulnerable and can be exploited by an attacker may sum 
    up to fall under attack surface management.

    organization who can't afford it. It is open source initative so that the independent security researchers
    can build their vulnerability management program with ease.
